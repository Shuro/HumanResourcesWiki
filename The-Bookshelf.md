Books you buy or write yourself will only count as unlocked technologies when they're stored on a _bookshelf_. These constitute your library, and you should take good care of them. After all, a destroyed book means literally lost knowledge! Each shelf can store up to 12 books, and they link with research benches and study desks to improve researching and studying speed. This boost isn't a fixed and linear number, though. It depends on how many books your library holds on total, and the more books you have, the smaller the buff each book gives.

They can be found at the _Storage_ menu on the _Architect_ tab, or by selecting a _study desk_ or _research bench_.
