# Dependecies
You need one of those installed to run _Human Resources_ (beyond [HugsLib](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=818773962), of course). Why? Read the description.
* [Research Tree](steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/1266570759)
* [Research Pal](steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/946390822)

# Integrated
We did something to comply with these mods:
*[Go Explore](steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/1814100216): When a pawn succeds on a Research Request event, instead of your faction progressing toward the discovered tech, that is added to the pawns individual expertise. In order for the colony to benefit as a whole, he will have to write a book about it!
*[Thinking Spot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819265371&searchtext=Thinking+Spot): though the author is still working on it.
*[Humanoid Alien Races](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839005762): non-human pawns were excluded from _Human Resources_ functions to make it compatible. This means androids from [Android Tiers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1386412863) and robots from [Misc. Robots++](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724602224) don't get a tech tab and also can't learn, research or study techs. We believe this is very thematically appropriate! Other races that are marked as human-like still work.
*[No Job Authors](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009825774)
*[ZARS Tribalism](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1818707815) & [Production](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1820484592)

# Incompatible 
Those mods conflict directly with _Human Resources_, the ideas simply don't work together. Please, don't insist.
* [Tech Advancing](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/735268789): all it does is increase your research speed when you hit certain milestones. With _Human Resources_, your research speed is slower on purpose, and it only increses slightly on each book you add to your library. It's two fundamentally opposed directions. Also, the vanilla penalty for starting on tribal still applies.
*[Tech Sales](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/1935360087)
*[TechBlock](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1970774610)
*[Material Filter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541305730)
*[RimmuNation](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1608498683): prevented weapons from being considered universally known.
*[Rimsenal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725947920): prevented weapons from being considered universally known.
*[Stargate](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1998203184): prevented weapons from being considered universally known.
*[Borderlands](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1911170462): prevented weapons from being considered universally known.
*[Polarisbloc](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498573216): prevented weapons from being considered universally known.
*[Weapon Tech](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542854752): prevented weapons from being considered universally known.
*[Simple Sidearms](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=927155256)
*[Prision Labor](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1899474310)
*[Vanilla Storytellers Expanded - Perry Persistent](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2149702069): so the _Man in the Coat_ knows how to use his weapon.
*[Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2149755445): all starting pawns on the _Mercenary Squad_ scenario know how to use all starting weapons.
*[Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2052918119): all starting pawns on the _Bandits_ scenario know how to use all starting weapons.
*[Pawnmorpher](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1786466855): pawns on the _Escaped Morphs_  scenario know how to use all starting weapons.

# Known issues
There are issues when running these mods alongside _Human Resources_ and we can't solve it on our end (or we're still working on it, and if that's the case it will be noted). They're mostly harmless, though.

* [Simple Search Bar](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1827546987): is unable to search within our bills. We recommend using [Rimworld Search Agency](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=726479594) instead. It performs the same functions and works well.
* [Techprinting](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2100243898) (pending analysis)
* [Ammunition mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1892397131): learning or practicing weapons spends amuunition like crazy.
