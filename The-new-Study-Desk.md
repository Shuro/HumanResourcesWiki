This is where your pawns will acquire knowledge, using the _study technology_ recipe, and also output their own expertise into books, using the _document technology_ recipe. You can select which knowledge will be studied or documented on the ingredients panel. Both tasks are governed by the pawn's _intellectual_ skill and the time it takes to complete them depends on the technology complexity.

In order to **learn** a technolgy, pawns must be assigned to _Study_ on the work tab, the correspondent book must be available on your library and the pawn must already know all parent techs. Only discovered techs will show up on the ingredients filter panel. 

When it comes to **writing books**, the pawn must also be assigned to _Study_ on the work tab and, obviously, he must know the desired tech already. Only undiscovered techs will show up on the ingredients filter panel.
