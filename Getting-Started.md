The changes this mod makes to the game aren't that many, but being to some key game mechanics they might take some getting used to. I'm writing this guide to lay out some fundamentals so you don't get too frustrated trying to figure this out. I hope it helps!

Keep in mind the mod is still in a beta testing phase, so there might be changes and improvements in the future.

### 1. When you start, your pawns are useless. Get used to it!
This mod's goal is to create more challenge to you, and it does that by making everyday tasks on RimWorld a little harder. Everytime your colonists try to build, repair, craft or sow something, or use a weapon, the game will verify if their knowlege allows them to do that. (This only applies to your human colonists, all enemies, visitors and robots should behave normally.) Obviously that will require you to pay close attention to your pawns' capabilities and to who does what. But that also means _access_ to a tecnology is going to play a huge role. Many trivial tasks on a RimWorld game are actually locked behind research projects, and usuallly we don't pay too much attention to that because it comes embedded with the starting scenario or it's easy to research. _Passive Cooler, Complex Furniture, Complex Clothing, Smithing_ and _Stonecutting_ are good examples of fundamental techs you'll suffer without. Just imagine going without passive coolers, beds, tables, clothes, metal weapons of any kind and stone walls and you'll get the picture! Normally, once they are discovered, the capability of producing those things is automatically unlocked for all pawns. If its a starting tech, it's a no-brainer. Well, not anymore! Now it's going to be your job to distribute those capabilites around, and there will be extra steps. Also, since researching is going to be harder, the techs you start with can be the difference between life and death! So...

### 2. Don't rely on their starting knowledge
For every human-like pawn spawned the game will generate a starting knowledge, consisting of some technology expertise and some weapon proficiencies. This is based on a number of factors (TO-DO: detail) and you can tweak the starting technology pool for your own colonists (TO-DO: explain how), but the procedure is largely randomized and most importantly, **based on the pawns' faction tech level**. This means _tribals_ have a higer chance of getting basic techs and the default _crashlanded_ scenario _New Arrivals_ might be good with eletronics and geothermal power, but they will suck when it comes to building a chair! How to get around this? Well, pay attention to what are the techs you started with, because **the starting techs are always available on the study desk, even if you don't have the books yet**. Therefore, the first order of business is to **build a Study Desk** one and put them to study those. If needed, you can edit the scenario you choose before starting the game to include some tech you feel you're going to need right away (Scenario Editor > Edit Mode > Add part > Start with research).

## 3. Weapon proficiency doesn't depend on technology expertise
The weapons list your pawn is given when he's spawn 


Here are my advices:


They start with knowledge of some technologies
