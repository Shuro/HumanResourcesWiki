The _simple_ and _high tech research benches_ have been modified to work as regular work stations, with only one recipe each: _research_. We also made them more compact, considering you'll need lots of space for your new book shelves. Remember: books on connected book shelves improve research speed. Other than that, they keep their base characteristics, including the ability to connect with a _multi-analyser_.

They can be found at the _Production_ menu on the _Architect_ tab.

**Cost to build** (unchanged)
Simple Research Bench: 25 steel + 75 wood/metal.
Hi-Tech Research Bench: 10 components + 250 wood/metal.
