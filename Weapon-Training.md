The _training dummy_ and the _target stand_ are the facilities for learning to use melee and ranged weapons, respectively. Any weapon will be made avaiable for this once their associated technology is unlocked (_i.e._ added to the library). There are **two** recipes: use _learn weapon_ to aquire a new proficiency and _Practice melee/shooting_ to simply improve the pawn's skill on that kind of weapon (an easy way to gain XP and keep them sharp!). Pawns must be assigned to _learn_ on the work tab, and the relevant skill corresponds to the used weapon.
