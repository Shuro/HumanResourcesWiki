Books you buy or write yourself will only count as unlocked technologies when they're stored on a _book shelf_. These constitute your library, and you should take good care of them. After all, a destroyed book means literally lost knowledge! Each shelf can store up to 12 books, and they link with research benches and study desks to improve researching and studying speed. This boost isn't a fixed and linear number, though. It depends on how many books your library holds on total, and the more books you have, the smaller the buff each book gives.
